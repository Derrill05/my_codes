<center><h1><font color="green" face="Rockwell-">1.Love in Return</font></h1></center><br>
<font color="green" face="Rockwell"size="4">
<p><center>We did it because we saw it right,</center></p>
<p><center>See,seen,saw still remains sight.</center></p>
<p><center>The maker was watching.</center></p>
<p><center>Through His frontmen He spoke,</center></p>
<p><center>No positive response.</center></p>
<p><center>Humans still finding a way in the dark.</center></p>
<p><center>Sight in the night?</center></p>
<p><center>The whole humanity must be joking,</center></p>
<p><center>And the joking,he called it sinning,</center></p>
<p><center>Fighting to be clean,</center></p>
<p><center>Poor humans battling sin as they sin</center></p><br><br>
<p><center>And the boss had to show love in return.</center></p>
<p><center>No more of this,he said.</center></p>
<p><center>Blindness against the darkness,</center></p>
<p><center>Sacrifices after sacrifices,</center></p>
<p><center>Still their way to righteousness blurred,</center></p>
<p><center>"I need the final blood</center></p>
<p><center>Who's to go for them?</center></p>
<p><center>yes,you my son</center></p>
<p><center>Go, be their sacrificial lamb</center></p>
<p><center>They've gone dumb,their spirits numb."</center></p><br><br>
<p><center>The sent obeys,</center></p>
<p><center>Because of the father's love for humanity.</center></p>
<p><center>Not that he hated the son,</center></p>
<p><center>But it was now the offspring as an offering,</center></p>
<p><center>Coming to save us from our pleasures,</center></p>
<p><center>Giving love without measures,</center></p>
<p><center>Pursuing humanity</center></p>
<p><center>For oneness in diversity,</center></p>
<p><center>Born happily only to die mercilessly,</center></p>
<p><center>Hung by the same humanity.</center></p><br><br>
<p><center>We set a day,to remember of his birth,</center></p>
<p><center>We set another one for his death,</center></p>
<p><center>And another one for his ressurection,</center></p>
<p><center>But still sin and sin.</center></p>
<p><center>In return,he shows love,</center></p>
<p><center>Thousands of second chances we receive,</center></p>
<p><center>His salvation in us to retrieve.</center></p>
<p><center>But his dad, the boss,questions us,</center></p>
<p><center>Did we allow his son to be born in us?</center></p>
<p><center>Did we allow him to ressurect in us?</center></p>

<center><h1><font color="purple">2.The Dark World</font></h1></center>
<div style="color: purple;">
<font face="Rockwell" size="4">
<p><center>Away from town,</center></p>
<p><center>Back to the land,</center></p>
<p><center>Where greetings are compulsory</center></p>
<p><center>But teenage greeting hugs  abominated,</center></p>
<p><center>Stink eyes,whispers against urban dressing.</center></p>
<p><center>Who's to enlighten it?</center></p><br><br>
<p><center>A twenty minute boy-girl talk</center></p>
<p><center>"This is Immorality"</center></p>
<p><center>A single English word around the elders</center></p>
<p><center>"This is pride"</center></p>
<p><center>This dark world.</center></p>
<p><center>Who's to enlighten it?</center></p><br><br>
<p><center>Rooted to culture,</center></p>
<p><center>Anchored to tradition,</center></p>
<p><center>Submissive to the natural arena,</center></p>
<p><center>but always negating revolution.</center></p>
<p><center>Who's to enlighten them?</center></p><br><br>
<p><center>The same 'them',</center></p>
<p><center>Sending kids to school,</center></p>
<p><center>But rebel the enlightenment</center></p>
<p><center>brought by the kids </center></p>
<p><center>Who's to enlighten them?</center></p><br><br>
<p><center>Perhaps they'll one day understand,</center></p>
<p><center>But they should have,</center></p>
<p><center>Perhaps prayer can change them,</center></p>
<p><center>But they have their gods.</center></p>
<p><center>Who's to enlighten them?</center></p>

<p><center>A call he couldn't decline,
<p><center>With its source unknown,
<p><center>Yippee,the call was orchestral,
<p><center>Its rhythm soul-soothing.
